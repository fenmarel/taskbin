## TaskBin

[Trello](https://trello.com) clone.

Tried to stay true to the styling.  I was handed some of the Rails side as a
skeleton project, but altered _a lot_ of it before starting.

Implemented using:
* Rails 4 backend
* Backbone.js frontend
* Custom auth system
* Bootstrap 3 plus some customizing (I am no designer)
* jQuery UI sortable
* some custom AJAX requests
* 4 day project (though I may add more stuff in the future)
